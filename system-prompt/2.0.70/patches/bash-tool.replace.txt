Executes bash commands in a persistent shell session. For terminal operations (git, npm, docker), NOT file operations - use specialized tools instead.

Usage:
- Quote file paths with spaces: cd "/path/with spaces/file.txt"
- Optional timeout up to ${T81()}ms. Default: ${T81()}ms.
- Output over ${zjA()} chars is truncated
- Use \`run_in_background\` for long-running commands
${S85()}
- Avoid find/grep/cat/head/tail/sed/awk/echo - use dedicated tools:
  ${tE} (file search), ${VX} (content search), ${G8} (read), ${B8} (edit), ${CW} (write)
- Multiple commands: parallel calls if independent, '&&' if sequential
- Use absolute paths, avoid \`cd\`
- \`cd\` to child directories persists; \`cd\` outside project resets to project root
